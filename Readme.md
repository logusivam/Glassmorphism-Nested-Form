# Glassmorphism Form using HTML and CSS

This project demonstrates how to create a form using the Glassmorphism design trend with HTML and CSS. The form showcases a series of input fields displayed one after another, with a frosted glass-like appearance that enhances the visual appeal and user experience.

## Features

- **Glassmorphism Design**: Implements the glass-like aesthetic with frosted background and subtle shadows.
- **Responsive Layout**: The form adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Enhances the overall look and feel of web applications with a modern design trend.

## Installation

To use this project, simply download or clone the repository:

Alternatively, you can directly copy the HTML and CSS files into your project directory.

## Usage
